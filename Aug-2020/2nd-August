Problem:
Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.

You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 25¢.

For example, given n = 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10¢, a 5¢, and a 1¢.

Suggested solution:

Simply divide n by the largest denomination to get the quotient. If the reminder is not 0, 
then continue to divide by the next smaller denomination (as compared to previous step) to 
get the second quotient. Continue to do this till the reminder is 0. Then all up all the
quotients.


def min_coins (n, index):
    denomination_list = [1, 5, 10, 25]

    quotient =int  (n / denomination_list[index])
    remainder = n % denomination_list[index]

    if remainder == 0:
        return quotient
    else:
        quotient += min_coins(remainder, index -1)

    return quotient



if __name__ == "__main__":
    print (min_coins (n,3))  # choose any amount for n in cents
