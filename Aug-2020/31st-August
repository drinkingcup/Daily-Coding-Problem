Problem:

Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards 
represented as an array using only swaps.

It should run in O(N) time.

Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

Answer:
The problem is quite ambiguous for me so I am going to code based on the following assumptions:
(a) the random numbers between 1 and k refer to the number of shuffles on the deck of cards
(b) using the basic overhand shuffling method.
