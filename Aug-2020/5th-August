Problem:
What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())

Answer:
It will print out the following:
9
9
9
9
9
9
9
9
9
9

Suggested solution:

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append((lambda i : i)(i))

for f in functions:
    print(f)
