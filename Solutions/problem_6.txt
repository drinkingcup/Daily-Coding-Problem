Answer:

For file syncing between 2 computers over low bandwidth, hashes will be required.
Step 1: Perform hashing on all individual files such that each file has a hash value.
Step 2: Then perform hashing on the folder that contain these files.
Step 3: Perform hashing on the next higher level folder that contain the folder in step 2.
Step 4: Repeat step 3 until the root folder is obtained.
    
Let's consider the following example below:

Computer A
C:\ -> Windows\ -> System32\ -> drivers\ -> etc -> (1)hosts (2)services

If the hosts files changes (services files remain the same), the hash value of hosts_file will change.
Accordingly, the hash value of etc folder which contain the 2 files will change as well.
This changes will continue upwards till the hash value of C drive changes as well.
    
Computer B
When computer B performs a file sync operation, it realises that the hash value of C drive has changed.
It drills down to the lower level folder(Windows folder) and finds that the hash value of has changed as well.
It then continues till it reaches the 2 files inside the etc folder.
When it detects that the hash value of the hosts file has changed, it will copy that file from Computer A for replacement.
