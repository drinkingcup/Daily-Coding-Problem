Problem 2:
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.

You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 25¢.

For example, given n = 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10¢, a 5¢, and a 1¢.
